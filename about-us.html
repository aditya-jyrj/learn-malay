                    <p>Founded in 2006, Agape School of Education has welcomed over 13,000 students on their language-learning journeys. The name <em>Agape</em> comes from ancient Greek, referring to a profound, unconditional love – distinct from friendship (<em>philia</em>) or familial affection (<em>storge</em>).</p>
                    <p>This spirit of <em>agape</em> guided our beginnings, as founder Mr. Gilbert Ndiaye (rightmost in the photo) and his students from NUS selflessly built the school out of a shared love for languages. Today, that same passion remains at our core: to nurture in every learner an enduring, unconditional love for language and culture.</p>
